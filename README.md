#Multilanguaging
The multilanguaging system is used since version 1.1-alpha. Supported languages so far: German and English.

#How to play
The game is not yet easy to play when you don't know what to do, so here is a short tutorial.
 1. Choose your prefered language.
 When starting the game for the first time there will be a window asking you to choose your language. This is saved, you won't be asked again.
 2. Create a player.
 In the main menu, there is a button 'create player'. If you haven't created a player yet, click there and type your name.
 3. Get started.
 Time of Kings has three main resources: Wood, stone and iron. These are represented by the bars on the top-right corner of your screen.
 To get a city working, you will need a building to do adminstrations. Click somewhere in the middle. At the bottom of your screen, select 'building menu' and select the building you want to build. The only thing you have to build is the community hall. After you selected it, it appears on the field where you clicked first. Building and upgrading your buildings costs resources, so you should build a sawmill, quarry and mine first, so you produce some new. Get a storage to  be able to store more resources to upgrade more expensive buildings.
